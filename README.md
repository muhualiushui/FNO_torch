# Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)

## Introduction
The Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is designed to solve Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems in realâ€‘world applications. This repository contains implementations of FNO focused on 1D and 2D PDE cases using PyTorch.

### Environment Setup
To set up your environment to use the Fourier Neural Operator, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary packages using pip or conda:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   conda install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> ### Notice for GPU Users
> Ensure your installed `torch` and `torchvision` versions match your CUDA toolkit. You can find the correct command for your CUDA version at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.  
> If needed, uninstall and reinstall PyTorch with:

> ```bash
> pip uninstall torch torchvision
> pip install torch==<version>+cuXXX torchvision==<version>+cuXXX -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
> ```

### Using FNO
Once the environment is set up, import the FNO module in your scripts or notebooks:
```python
from FNO_torch import FNOnd
# then instantiate and train your model
```

### Examples
Examples of execution are stored in `test_1d.ipynb` and `test_2d.ipynb`. These notebooks demonstrate how to apply the Fourier Neural Operator in 1D and 2D PDE problems with PyTorch.
